                <p className={Styles.sectionText}>
                  TradeJournalAI was born from the real challenges faced by independent traders who struggled to find affordable, comprehensive tools for tracking and analyzing their trading performance. As engineering students passionate about both technology and financial markets, we recognized the gap between expensive institutional tools and basic spreadsheet tracking.
